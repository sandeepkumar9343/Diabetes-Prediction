# Diabetes-Prediction
# Introduction:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage (by UCI Machine Learning).

# Variables:
1) Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

2) Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

3) BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

4) SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 

5) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

6) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

8) Age: Age (years)

9) Outcome: Class variable(0 or 1) (Target Variable)

# Algorithm Used:
Logistic Regression, Decision tree, KNearestNeighbour, Support Vector Classification Algorithms are used.
